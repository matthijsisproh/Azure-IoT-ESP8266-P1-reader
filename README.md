# Azure-IoT-ESP8266-P1-reader
Welcome to the 'Azure-IoT-ESP8266-P1-reader' repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for energy monitoring and management using IoT technology. By utilizing an ESP8266 device to read data from the P1 port, this project enables you to obtain real-time information about your energy consumption and usage patterns.

The project also includes integration with Microsoft Azure IoT Central application, a cloud-based platform for IoT device management and data analysis. By connecting your ESP8266 device to this platform, you can easily monitor, analyze, and visualize your energy usage data, and gain insights into energy-saving opportunities.

In this repository, you'll find all the necessary code and instructions to set up your own energy monitoring system using ESP8266 devices and Microsoft Azure IoT Central application. The code includes libraries for reading data from the P1 port, connecting to Azure IoT Central, and sending data to the cloud platform. Additionally, we have provided detailed instructions on how to set up your own IoT Central application and configure your ESP8266 device.

I hope this project will help you to better understand your energy consumption and make more informed decisions about your energy usage. Feel free to explore the code, contribute to the project, and share your feedback with me.
